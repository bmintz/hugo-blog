title: "Migrating PostgreSQL SERIAL Columns to IDENTITY"

PostgreSQL introduced [identity columns](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/postgresql-10-identity-columns/) in version 10 which offer a number of advantages.
As it happens, I had some old SERIAL columns that I wanted to migrate to the new IDENTITY thing but couldn't find any instructions online.
So here's how you do it at the `psql` shell. Assuming `TABLE a(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);` with some rows already:

```none
start transaction isolation level serializable;
alter table a alter column id drop default;
select nextval('a_id_seq');  -- pretend it's 368
drop sequence a_id_seq;
alter table a alter column id add generated by default as identity (start with 368);
commit;
```
